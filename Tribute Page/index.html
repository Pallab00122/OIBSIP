                    <b>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose</b>  was born into wealth and privilege in a large
                    Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. The early recipient of an Anglocentric education,
                    he was sent after college to England to take the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded with
                    distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the routine final exam, citing
                    nationalism to be a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement
                    led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership
                    in a group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open to
                    socialism.[i] Bose became Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939, differences arose
                    between him and the Congress leaders, including Gandhi, over the future federation of British India
                    and princely states, but also because discomfort had grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's
                    negotiable attitude to non-violence, and his plans for greater powers for himself.[15] After the
                    large majority of the Congress Working Committee members resigned in protest,[16] Bose resigned as
                    president and was eventually ousted from the party

                        1921–1932: Indian National Congress.Subhas Bose, aged 24, arrived ashore in India at Bombay on
                        the morning of 16 July 1921 and immediately set about arranging an interview with Mahatma
                        Gandhi. Gandhi, aged 51, was the leader of the non-cooperation movement that had taken India by
                        storm the previous year and in a quarter-century would evolve to secure its independence

                        1941: Escape to Nazi Germany.Bose's arrest and subsequent release set the scene for his escape
                        to Nazi Germany, via Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. A few days before his escape, he sought
                        solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting British guards and grew a beard.

                        Bose' defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians,[ao][ap][aq]
                        however his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy fraught with
                        authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure
